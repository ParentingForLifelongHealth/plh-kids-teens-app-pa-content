I often did not follow the rules, because they were too harsh, I did not understand what they were saying, or I would not even bother listening to them, because we were all angry.\n\nOne day, they asked me: Let's think together what the consequence should be for not coming home in time. It was great to give my view – before something happens that makes us all angry. We are all calm and agree first. It is easier for me to follow the rules now because I know I agreed on the rule and on the consequence if I do not follow the rule."
